# A/B Test and Event Funnel Analysis
Analytical study of data from an international online store. A/B test results and log of customers and their activities in the store provided. Stakeholders from the online store determine that a 10% increase in user conversion is achievable due to the improved recommendation system.

# Goal
The goal of the analysis is to test the changes brought on by the introduction of an improved recommendation system. We need to determine if the expected increase of at least 10% in user conversion from one stage of the funnel to the other was achieved, thus proving the improved system successful. In order to come to a conclusion, we need to study the event funnel and analyze an A/B test. We need to study conversion at different funnel stages and determine if the A/B test was performed correctly as well as analyze its results. The users are split into two groups: the control group gets the old system (A) and the test group (B) gets the new system. 

# Task Decomposition
- Analyzed the results of an A/B test of the improved system.
- Studied conversion rates at each stage of the event funnel.
- Performed Statistical Analysis on A/B test groups.
